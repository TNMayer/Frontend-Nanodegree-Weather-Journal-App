# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires to create an asynchronous web app that uses the OpenWeatherMap Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. This project is part of a Udacity Nanodegree in Frontend Webdevelopment which I am currently taking.

## Instructions
In order to run the app locally you should do the following steps:
* Install an Express server: npm install express
* Install body-parser: npm install body-parser
* Install cors: npm install cors
* Get an API key from https://openweathermap.org/api
* Replace the API key in ./website/app.js (line 2)
* Start the server locally: node server.js
